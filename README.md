# Rank-Attack-Detection
The objective of this project is to develop a detection system for rank attacks within DODAG networks. A rank attack involves malicious nodes manipulating their rank in the routing protocol, leading to incorrect routing paths and potentially disrupting network communication. Aims to identify such attacks using machine learning techniques.
